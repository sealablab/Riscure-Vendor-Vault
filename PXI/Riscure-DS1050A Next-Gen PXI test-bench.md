# Riscure [DS1050A Next Generation test-bench](https://www.keysight.com/us/en/product/DS1050A/next-generation-embedded-security-testbench.html)
Purchase of the **DS1050A** is equivalent to purchasing the following individually:
## 1) [[PXI/Keysight-M9046A PXIe chassis]]
This is a big beefy PXI chassis
## 2) [[PXI/Keysight-M9038A PXI Controller]]
This is a regular old computer that lives inside the chassis.
## 3) [[PXI/Riscure-DS1060A Pattern Based Trigger Generator]] (icWaves)
Confusing name - this is basically the PXI equivalent of the former `IcWaves`
## 4-a) [[PXI/Riscure-DS1070A Glitch Pattern Generator]] (Spider)
Confusing name - this is the PXI equivalent of the former `Spider`
## 4-b) [[PXI/Riscure-DS1071A Glitch Pattern Generator]] (Also Spider)
Confusing name - this is __also__  the PXI equivalent of the former `Spider` ?
