# Riscure  [DS1320A Body Bias Injection Probe Needles](https://www.keysight.com/us/en/product/DS1320A/body-bias-injection-probe-needles.html)

Body bias injection (BBI) is a relatively new technique in fault injection which has been adopted by several security testing schemes. By extending the DS1121A Bidirectional Fault Injection Probe with the DS1320A Body Bias Injection Probe Needles, you can ensure that your chips are robust against this technique. A BBI probe injects faults in a very small location, allowing you to pinpoint security vulnerabilities to a more specific location.

- Get full BBI attack coverage in a dedicated package: forward (FBBI), reverse (RBBI), and large voltage range for attack scenarios on all chips 
- Includes two FBBI and two RBBI probes in high and low voltage 
- Prevent scratches on the substrate with spring-driven needles
- Penetrate thick substrates with a 200 V maximum output 
- Easily connect to DS1121A Bidirectional Fault Injection Probe with an SMA connector
