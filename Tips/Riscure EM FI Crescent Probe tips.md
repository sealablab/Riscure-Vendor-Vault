# Riscure EM FI **Crescent** Probe tips
 
The Crescent probe tip is made of two windings around a ferrite ring with an air gap.

 **The direction of the EM field generated by the crescent probe tip **differs from the classic probe tips**. 

> [!TIP]  Try a crescent probe tip when you are trying to induce a glitch via __bus lines__ and **wires**
