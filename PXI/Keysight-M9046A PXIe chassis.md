the **M9046A**  is a PXIe 18-slot PXIe chassis at the core of the [[PXI/Riscure-DS1050A Next-Gen PXI test-bench]]

It is included with purchase of the [[PXI/Riscure-DS1050A Next-Gen PXI test-bench]]



## Highlights

The M9046A PXIe 18-slot chassis delivers the power and cooling required for high-performance applications. It includes 3 PXIe hybrid slots which gives the system designer the flexibility to mix PXIe and hybrid-compatible modules. With its Gen 3 backplane and x24 system slot, it is ready to tackle high-data bandwidth applications.  

The M9046A is new from the ground up including a new power supply design providing unprecedented power per-slot capabilities with the ability to monitor power and control switching frequency on a per-slot basis. With improved airflow, the improvement in cooling performance results in superior acoustic performance with up to a maximum of 85 watts per slot. The chassis is also designed for easy integration into large systems containing multiple PXIe chassis and other non-PXI instrumentation including access to 8 hardware trigger lines without consuming a slot.

Cooling high-power PXI Modules (>38W) is complex and has many variables. Variations in Chassis and Module designs result in different cooling characteristics, such as cooling per slot and the cooling profile across a module within a slot that can impact the modules specifications and safety.

Due to that complexity and lack of an interoperable standard, high-power PXI Chassis and Modules from different companies were designed separately and may not be interoperable. Currently, there is not an initiative within the PXISA to try to specify a mechanism for guaranteeing interoperability, so it is recommended that you use the high-power PXI Chassis from the same company you are purchasing the high-power PXI Module from.

**Functionality**

- 3 PXIe hybrid slots, 13 PXIe slots, 1 PXIe timing slot, and 1 PXIe system slot
- High power with up to 1675W usable power
- Up to 85 W/slot cooling with exceptional acoustical performance
- Multi-chassis power-sequencing and optional rear trigger access

**Performance Characteristics**

- High performance Gen 3 backplane with a two link (x8 and x16) system slot and x8 links to the PXIe slots
- Backplane speeds of up to 24 GB/s system and 8 GB/s slot-to-slot
- Innovative chassis cooling system with increased volume of airflow for improved per-slot cooling and lower acoustical noise
